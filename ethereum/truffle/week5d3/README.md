# Truffle
Before you run truffle, you need to change dir into the project:

First, let's create a truffle project with no smart contracts included

    truffle init

This will create those paths, 

  - contracts: a directory for Solidity contracts
  - migrations: a directory for scriptable deployment files
  - test: a directory for test files for testing your application and contracts
  - truffle-config.js: a file for the truffle configuration
